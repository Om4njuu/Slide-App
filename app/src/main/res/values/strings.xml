    <string name="space_about_message">Slide is a strategic board game with two modes: one-player (PvE) and two-player (PvP local). You play against the computer or your friend, which uses a strong greedy strategy. The game is played on a 5x5 board where you and the computer or your friend take turns placing tokens from the top (1-5) or the left (A-E). Tokens slide existing ones over or down, possibly pushing them off the board. The goal is to get five tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You play as moon, and the computer or your friend plays as sun. Enjoy the challenge!</string>
